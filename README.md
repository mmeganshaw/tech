Do you like TECHNOLOGY? Do you like.. THE NEWS? How about applications built by people that combine those two things into one? 

If you answered yes to at least one of those questions, boy do I have the full-stack application for you. 

Introducting.. Tech. The super superb web scraping application built with a Handlebars layout, an ExpressJS server, the Cheerio Web Scraping NPM package, a MongoDB schemaless database, and Mongoose schemas to make a schemaless database.. schemafull! 

In this application you can click "Scrape" to get all of the newest tech articles available from The Verge. Once you have scraped the site, you can then save notes to each article that are saved to the database so you can (you guessed it) come back to your notes later on! You can even get in fake "note battles" with yourself if you want to! But please don't. This application is live and I'd really appreciate if you did that on someone else's application.
